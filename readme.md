# Weather App

Built using: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Developed and designed a current weather detection responsive website for cities using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The website will allow the user to enter a particular city in the portal and the integrated weather API then fetches the
relevant data and displays the temperature, description of weather, humidity and wind speed.
